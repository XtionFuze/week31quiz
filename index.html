        <h2>My favorite part of Advanced Web</h2>
        <p>My favorite part of Patino is how small the school is. 
           Next, how clean and modern the school is versus others. 
           Last is how nice the majority of teachers are and how they actually kind of show that they care about the students and don't just see them as a way to get money.</p>
        <h2>My least favorite part of Advanced Web</h2>
        <p>My least favorite part of Patino is how disrepectful most of the students are to the staff, esspecially the junior class. 
           Next, how we are kept hostage afterhours for things that could easily be done during school hours, people have lives you know, just because we are minors doesnt mean that we don't. 
           Last but not least is how some of the teachers barely update grades, it makes it hard for you to know what you are missing work-wise if grades arent updated.</p>
